# Understanding the Effect of a Dominance Hierarchy on Social Animals

This repository contains code uesd to investigate the effect of a domiance hierachy on a gorup of social animals. Both uninformed and informed models are produced. They take a vareity of inputs such as; group size, the space in which the agents operate in and initial healths. The agent-based models then help to determine that hat the presence of the dominance hierarchy is disadvantageous to a social group of animals whereby the effect of the dominance hierarchy is amplified with an increasing degree of visibility. However, we note that there are other factors not discussed in this report that need to be explored in order for the full effect of the dominance hierarchy to be understood.

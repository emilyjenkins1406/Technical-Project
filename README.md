## Understanding the Effect of a Dominance Hierarchy on the Foraging Patterns of Social Animals

### Main:

foraging.m : This is the main file from which the other simulations are run and extracted is compiled.

### Unknown Model:

foraging_unknown_food.m : This creates a simulation of agents where the food locations are unknown. 

### Known Model:

foraging_known_food.m : This creates a simulation of agents whereby the food locations are known.

### Known with Weightings Model:

foraging_known_food_weights.m :  This creates a simulation of agents whereby the food locations are known weightings/penalties are applied to allow an agent to pick the optimal food location to go to.

### Other files:

plotgraphh.m : This is used to plot my graphs in pdf form which is compatible with Latex. 

plotting_multiple_agents.m : This is used to plot the percentage of deaths and eating for various agents from multiple simulations.

### Main:

foraging.m : This is the main file from which the other simualtions are run and extracted is compiled.

### Unknown Model:

foraging_unknown_food.m : This creates a simulation of agents where the food loactions are unknown. 

### Known Model

foraging_known_food.m : This creates a simulation of agents whereby the food locations are known.

### Known with Weightings Model

foraging_known_food_weights.m :  This creates a simulation of agetns whereby the food lociations are known weightings/penalties are applied to allow an agent to pick the optimal food location to go to.

### Other files:

plotgraphh.m : This is used to plot my grpahs in pdf form which is compatiable with Latex.

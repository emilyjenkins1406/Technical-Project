## Foraging:

## Unknown:

euler+runge_timesteps.py : Euler and Runge-Kutta routines that generate a series of numerical solution estimates for ODEs.

## Known:

numericalshooting.py : Using shooting to solve a boundary value problem of ODEs.

testscript.py : A test script that runs my shooting code and tests its solutions. 

numericalcontinuation.py : Performing natural parameter continuation to find solutions for ODEs.

## Known with Weightings:

1DDiffusion.py : A implementation of Forward Euler, Backward Euler and Crank-Nicholson to numerically solve partial differential equations.
